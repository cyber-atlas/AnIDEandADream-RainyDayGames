	Meeting Notes - 5 September 2018

*We are going to meeting notes for everytime we meet, maybe throw some pictures in for funzies

*Discussed the way we will be using branches in Git

	Git Setup
	---------

Releases Branch - Official code releases, 
	Releases will be made when the team is happy with where the master branch is.
	All release code should work well together without error. 
	The team should be satified with the features at that current state
Master Branch - Working code branch
	The code works together, but it may not be ready for a full release yet
Development Branch - Working untested code '
	The branch where we push our working features. 
	The features may not all be fully complete with their subfeatures.
	The features may work for the person who made it but not necessarily with the rest of the
		code or for the rest of the people. 
	The dev branch is always based on the master branch and will usually be ahead of master,
		never behind.
Feature Branches - Branches for features of the project
	This is where the code is being developed for a feature, ie a game, or chat or something
		of the like. 
	Each feature may have subfeatures. 
	May not always be working, but will be functional before it is pushed to the Development
		branch.
Subfeature Branches - Sub branches to features
	This is where things being developed for features will be. Ie CPU for a specific game, 
		or socketing for a specific game. 
	This code may or may not be working, but should be working decently before pushed to the respective parent feature.
